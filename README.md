# instatype
Social media semantic analysis tool that integrates with [Clarifai](http://www.clarifai.com/) and [uClassify](https://uclassify.com/) to analyze the pictures you post on Instagram and generate detailed sentiment analysis on your content.

As a social experiment, the user's actual result will likely always be ESFP/ESTP because of pressure to conform to social media in an attempt to make yourself seem exciting.

The goal of InstaType is for the user to learn more about themselves and spot trends and relations throughout the year based on their social media content.
We want to keep evolving InstaType in order to provide the best analytics for your social media!

Planned features:
---
1. Integration with more social media networks (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc)
1. More granular data visualizations for specific trends throughout the year.
